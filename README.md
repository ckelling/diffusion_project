## Abstract:
Structural features of social networks have important implications for the spread of diseases, information,
and health behaviors. For example, a disease may travel through one social network much more quickly
than through another given certain characteristics of the networkâ€™s structure, like the level of clustering
in the network. However, the precise effects of different network structural features on different types of
diffusion are unknown. Part of the reason for this gap in knowledge is that many structural features of
networks are highly correlated and it is often difficult, and sometimes impossible, to change one feature
without altering others, which precludes isolating the effects of different structural features. For instance,
prior work has demonstrated mixed effects of network clustering on diffusion depending on whether or not
dispersion in nodal degrees is fixed. In this study, we attempt to move beyond this impasse. To do so, we
examine the complete sets of a series of small, regular, isomorphic networks. These networks differ in their
levels of clustering and other features, but they allow us to make explicit comparisons between diffusions
propagating in networks with different levels of clustering but otherwise identical features. We test SI and
SIR diffusion models. As our outcomes, we analyze both the speed of network saturation or diffusion failure
and the ultimate size of the network reached by the diffusion. We compare effects of network clustering and
other structural features on these outcomes and find clear relationships between the variables.
